# Hello! 👋

## About Me 👀 

My name is Chris Townsend, I have worked in the software industry since 2014 and been in love with programming since I was 10 years old. I have had various roles in my career from a senior software engineer all the way to Engineer lead. I have worked for in-house software houses and design agencies, and predominantly focus on the backend stack. My main focus now is Go, but I also have over 6 years of experience using PHP, Symfony and Laravel.

* 💼 I'm currently working as an Engineering Team Lead for a team of 4 developers. The business runs a fintech platform mainly focused on DCB (Direct Carrier Billing). This is paying for services using your mobile phone bill. Our team is responsible for the intermediary layer between our 3rd parties (Mobile phone carriers) and our billing and subscription platform. 

* 🥞 Current Stack
    * Go - 90%
    * PHP - 10%
    * EKS - Kubernetes managed by AWS
    * Docker
    * PostgreSQL
    * AWS SNS and SQS
    * Microservices
