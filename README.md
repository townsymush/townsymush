# Hello! 👋

## About Me 👀 

My name is Chris Townsend, I have worked in the software industry since 2014 and been in love with programming since I was 10 years old. I have had various roles in my career from a senior software engineer all the way to Engineer lead. I have worked for in-house software houses and design agencies, and predominantly focus on the backend stack. My main focus now is Go, but I also have over 7 years of experience using PHP, Symfony and Laravel.
